		<p class="text-justify">By using the 'BEACON Q' application, you agree to the collection of anonymised usage data. The usage data is limited to the courses you register to, the quizzes you play, the surveys you fill out and the feedback you send, which may include anonymised log details for debugging reasons. That data is used for statistical purposes, and might be disclosed as part of scientific publications. No personal data will be collected or stored, and no data will be forwarded to any parties outside of the University of Luxembourg. 'BEACON Q' never requests personal information such as your real name, email address or location, and it does not collect other personal information such as your IP address, but it may collect basic device information such as your platform and application version. You may delete your account from within the application at any time.</p>
